# Cursor - The AI Code Editor Landing Page

This is a landing page clone of Cursor AI Code Editor website built using HTML and CSS. The project features a modern dark theme design with multiple sections showcasing different features and testimonials.

## About This Project

This is a static website that shows design and layout of the Cursor AI Code Editor homepage. The entire project is built with HTML and CSS without any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

## Technologies Used

The project uses HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling. Google Material Icons are used for arrow icons throughout the page. All other visual elements are custom styled using CSS.

## Project Structure

The project contains one main HTML file called index.html and one CSS file called style.css. There is also an Images folder that contains all the logos, screenshots, and avatar images used throughout the website. The Images folder has subfolders for grid logos, testimonial avatars, and feature section images.

## Main Sections

The website includes a fixed navigation bar at the top with menu items and action buttons. The hero section contains the main headline and a large feature image. Below that is a trusted companies section displaying logos of major tech companies in a grid layout.

There are three feature sections that alternate between left and right image placements. Each feature has a title, description, and a learn more link. The testimonials section displays six cards with quotes from industry leaders and their profile pictures.

The Stay on Frontier section has three cards highlighting key features with images. The changelog section shows recent updates in a grid format. There is a team section with a large photo and a call to action button.

The highlights section displays recent blog posts in a centered column layout. The final section before the footer has a large heading and download button. The footer contains five columns of links organized by category and a bottom bar with copyright, theme toggle, and language selector.

## Design Features

The website uses a dark color scheme with a background color of dark brown. All text is in white or light gray for good contrast. Cards and sections have subtle borders and background colors to create depth. Hover effects are applied to buttons and links to improve user interaction.

The layout is built using CSS Grid for multi-column sections and Flexbox for alignment. Images are responsive and scale properly on different screen sizes. The navigation bar stays fixed at the top when scrolling. All fonts use system default sans-serif fonts for fast loading.
